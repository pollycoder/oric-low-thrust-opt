## Environment

Requirements: [GPOPS-II](https://www.gpops2.com/) (Only necessary when you run the code under `/gpops`)

This is a software solving optimal control problem developed by NASA. If you do not have one, you can download it from the link above. 

**Attention: GPOPS-II could only work on computers with x86 or x64 architecture !**
